# How to use

## Create a new Workspace

A workspace is a space where you can group decks and notes.

## Import or create a Deck

Flix was created primarily to be a desktop application similar to Anki or a version of its.

For this reason you can import Anki files with the `.apkg` extension. Or create your own decks.

> For now Flix not enble the cration of cards

## Create Notes (Docs)

In addition to creating or importing decks, you can create and edit notes using `Markdown`.

This also allows you to use plain text.
